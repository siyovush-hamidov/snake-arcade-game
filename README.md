# Blockade Snake Game 🐍

A two-player arcade game built with OpenCV where players control snakes, avoid collisions, and leave trails. Red vs. Blue, who survives longer? 🚀

## Setup 🛠️

2. **Install OpenCV**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```
3. **Download Files**:
   - Save `blockade_snake.py` to a folder.
   - Add these images to the same folder:
     - `background.jpg` (game background)
     - `red_player.png` (red snake sprite)
     - `blue_player.png` (blue snake sprite)
